                    <p>Meesho: Building for Bharat and Redefining E-commerce in India
                        “Democratise internet commerce for everyone.” – Meesho’s mission, and its north star.
                        When Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Barnwal founded Meesho in December 2015 (originally as Fashnear),
                        their vision was simple yet powerful: enable small retailers and individuals to sell online
                        without heavy investment, particularly in India's Tier II, III, IV towns.
                        From those early days of cataloguing local shops by walking the streets, to becoming a platform
                        empowering millions of digital entrepreneurs from homes, the Meesho story is one of listening,
                        pivoting, and scaling with purpose.
