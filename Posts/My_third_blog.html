            <p class="mission-statement">“Fresh out of the kitchen, right to your doorstep.” – Zomato’s simple promise that transformed Indian dining.</p>

            <p>Zomato’s journey is one of vision, technology, and persistence. Founded by <strong>Deepinder Goyal</strong> and <strong>Pankaj Chaddah</strong> in 2008, this food-tech startup began as <em>FoodieBay</em>, a digital restaurant menu listing platform. Today, it’s a household name serving millions across India and beyond — a story of how one startup redefined convenience and culinary experiences for an entire generation.</p>

            <h3>Founders & Leadership</h3>
            <p><strong>Deepinder Goyal</strong>, an IIT Delhi graduate and former Bain & Co. consultant, founded Zomato after identifying a simple problem — colleagues struggling to find restaurant menus. His persistence turned that idea into a global food-tech leader. Despite his success, Goyal’s humility stands out — he waived his INR 3.5 crore salary (2021–2026) and continues leading Zomato with a long-term vision. He’s also known as a Shark on <em>Shark Tank India Season 3</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>Pankaj Chaddah</strong>, also from IIT Delhi, played a crucial role in shaping Zomato’s culture and operations. After a decade, he exited in 2018 and went on to co-found <em>Shyft (formerly Mindhouse)</em>, focusing on wellness and mindfulness. His time at Zomato is remembered for his leadership during critical transitions.</p>
